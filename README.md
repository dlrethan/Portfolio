## What I Learned

During this project I got really familar with flexbox, as well as making things mobile responsive! It was a lot of fun
to learn how to do everything on my own with the help of google whenever I got stuck and for got how to do something.
If this is a sign of things to come I am super excited to get into the tech field!
